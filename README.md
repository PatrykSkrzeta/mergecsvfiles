# MERGE MULTIPLE CSV FILES INTO ONE "MASTER" FILE
## INTRO
Paste all of your files into "main.py" folder and script will do the rest of work.
If you want to change csv files to excel files, you can use my python conventer, or change a little bit code in script replacing the csv with excel.
## INSTALLATION
pip install pandas
